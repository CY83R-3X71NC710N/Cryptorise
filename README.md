# CRYPTORISE
## Introduction
Cryptorise is an encryption algorithm created with Python with the purpose of creating a dynamic cryptography solution that uses artificial intelligence to analyze previously encrypted content and applies methods to prevent the same encryption algorithm from being used again. The algorithm uses mathematical operations, deep-learning neural networks, and multiple Python libraries such as to create a secure and automated cryptology system. 

This project is meant to be used as a prototype and should be built on and extended to become more powerful. As of right now, it should be noted that some URLs and keys may need to be updated when running the script on a reader's own machine. The code was created by CY83R-3X71NC710N and is currently under an MIT license. 

## Goals
1.  Create a dynamic encryption algorithm with the use of Python and AI that prevents previously used encryption from being used again. 
2. Develop a cryptology system that securely protects any data encrypted with it. 
3. Utilize multiple Python libraries for the project such as for deep-learning neural networks 
4. Develop an encryption algorithm that is open to being improved upon by the open-source community.
5. Develop an encryption algorithm that takes full advantage of AI’s capabilities.
6. Provide a secure, automated and dynamic solution for data encryption.
7. Improve upon existing encryption algorithms.
8. Create an algorithm that is easy to use and understand.
9. Develop a system that is capable of adapting to changes in encryption methods.
10. Create an algorithm that is scalable and continuously improving.

## Roadmap
1. Develop an algorithm capable of recognizing patterns in encrypted data.
2. Create a system that utilizes algorithms such as deep learning and neural networks.
